        <p className='text-3xl pb-2'><b>I Think My Biggest Fear Is True</b></p>

        I fear that people only see me as nothing more than a boring work-centric individual: a person who only cares about their career, 
                    does nothing other than study, and enjoys being alone.<br/><br/>

                    I fear that it&apos;s true.<br/><br/>

                    In reality, I enjoy being with others: spending time with people, getting to know a person&apos;s story, making memories, talking about 
                    similar interests, making mistakes, and being vulnerable.<br/><br/>

                    <i>&quot;Hey, let&apos;s hang out!&quot; &quot;We&apos;re going over to a friend&apos;s house. Do you wanna come?&quot; &quot;Come watch this game with us!&quot; &quot;I&apos;m hosting a dinner 
                    night; you should come!&quot; &quot;You&apos;re invited!&quot;</i><br/><br/>

                    My favorite questions and statements!<br/><br/>

                    The beginning of the year felt different. Maybe something about me changed, or my perspective compared to those I know differed, 
                    but something was off.<br/><br/>

                    <i>&quot;So, how&apos;d you get an internship at MIT?&quot; &quot;How often do you study?&quot; &quot;How&apos;s school been?&quot; &quot;Good job, Julian, you&apos;re so smart!&quot; &quot;Can 
                    you help me with an assignment?&quot; &quot;How&apos;s work?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re going to be rich one day!&quot;</i><br/><br/>

                    I hate these questions. But I don&apos;t understand, that&apos;s all I get asked. What changed?<br/><br/>

                    &quot;You disappeared&quot; is what I&apos;ve been told, but I feel like I was kicked out.<br/><br/>

                    I tried breaking out of my shell, but it&apos;s only driven people away.<br/><br/>

                    So many people surround me, yet I feel the most isolated. You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with, but I&apos;m 
                    surrounded by no one. Does that make me empty?<br/><br/>

                    How do I show people that I&apos;m more than work? I want to have fun, too. Do I even know how to have fun?<br/><br/>

                    A day without laughter is a day wasted. I suppose I&apos;ve been wasting my days away.<br/><br/> 

                    I&apos;m getting too lost in my thoughts, but I have no one to guide me. Tears fill my eyes only to be quickly wiped away.
                    A ticking time bomb in its final seconds.<br/><br/>
                                        
                    I want people to know who I am, but feelings aren&apos;t vice versa.<br/><br/>

                    I&apos;ve been described as &quot;nice, quiet, and unproblematic.&quot;<br/><br/>

                    Nice, only for me to be taken advantage of. Quiet, but I have the loudest mind in the room. 
                    Unproblematic, but I have no room to bleed.<br/><br/>

                    But maybe it&apos;s too late, and the vision that people see me as is set in stone.<br/><br/>

                    <i>Julian Sanchez, a computer science major who cares about their career, does nothing but study and enjoys being alone.</i><br/><br/>

                    Maybe nothing changed, and that&apos;s really who I am. I don&apos;t want to accept it, but I feel like other people have, 
                    so I guess I should too.<br/><br/>

                    I&apos;ve reached academic achievement, but a social calamity.<br/><br/>

                    My fear is true.<br/><br/>
